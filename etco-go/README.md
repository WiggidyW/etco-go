# etco-go

Monolithic backend for the EVE trading co program.

This program is optimized for quick start-up times to run efficiently in the cloud.

This program relies upon static .gob data files, and must be built using etco-go-builder.

This program can be deployed anywhere, but certain GCP services are hard-coded. These are hidden behind layers of abstraction, so this will likely change.
