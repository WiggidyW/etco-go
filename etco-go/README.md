# etco-go

Monolithic backend for the EVE trading co program.

This program is optimized for quick start-up times to run efficiently in the cloud.

This program relies upon static .gob data files, and must be built using etco-go-builder.

Currently, only GCP is supported, but direct references to GCP tooling are minimal, so this will likely change.
